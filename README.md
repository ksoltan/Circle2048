# Circle2048
The popular game 2048 with a twist: it is in circles.
Four concentric circles, that can each be separately rotated, contain tiles with powers of 2. The player rotates the circles until they are satisfied with their position and proceeds to combine them, either towards the center or the outside of the circle. With each combine move, a new number tile (usually a 2) is generated. The goal is to obtain a tile with the number 2048.
